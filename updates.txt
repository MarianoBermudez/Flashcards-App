is there a way to avoid reloading the cards on manage view?
create an .exe file?

add delete card confirmation pop up with checkbox to disable
check how are streamlit projects made (code/project structure/ ).
look for streamlit best practices


make a visualization? metrics? streak? animation? ballons
add filtering, sorting by date. 

check for repeted cards?



deploy.  test in mobile (change to sql db?)
requirements file
readme file
license?

Extra:
make it available for different users with different cards (and api keys). how to manage concurrency?
allow the user to change the prompt context

Problematic:
make the number of columns variable (manage view).
